# Security Fixes Summary - Company Access Control

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Users Route Security Issue**
**File:** `backend-PIXELFORGE-NEXUS/server/routes/users.js`
**Problem:** Admin users could access ALL users from ALL companies
**Fix:** Added company filter to all user-related queries

#### Changes Made:
- **GET /users:** Added `company: req.user.company._id` filter
- **GET /users/:id:** Added company ownership check for admin users
- **PUT /users/:id:** Added company ownership check for admin users 
- **DELETE /users/:id:** Added company ownership check for admin users
- **GET /users/stats/overview:** Added company filter to all aggregation queries

### 2. **All Active Projects Route Security Issue**
**File:** `backend-PIXELFORGE-NEXUS/server/routes/projects.js`
**Problem:** The `/projects/active` endpoint returned projects from ALL companies
**Fix:** Changed to use company-specific method

#### Changes Made:
- **GET /projects/active:** Changed from `Project.getAllActiveProjects()` to `Project.getAllActiveProjectsByCompany(req.user.company._id)`

### 3. **User Statistics Security Issue**
**File:** `backend-PIXELFORGE-NEXUS/server/routes/users.js`
**Problem:** User statistics showed data from ALL companies
**Fix:** Added company filter to all statistics queries

#### Changes Made:
- Added `companyFilter = { company: req.user.company._id }` to all statistics queries
- Updated aggregation pipeline to include company filter
- Updated count queries to include company filter

## Security Validation

Created and ran comprehensive security test (`test-security-fixes.js`) that:
1. Registers two different companies with admin users
2. Logs in both admin users
3. Verifies users endpoint only shows same company users
4. Verifies active projects endpoint only shows same company projects  
5. Creates a project for company 1
6. Confirms company 2 admin cannot see company 1's project

**Test Results:** ✅ All security fixes working correctly!

## What Was Already Secure

The following areas were already properly implementing company-based access control:
- Individual project access (using `checkProjectAccess` middleware)
- Project modification (using `checkProjectModifyAccess` middleware) 
- Developer assignment (checking company match)
- Project creation (automatically sets company)
- Document upload/access (company-based permissions)
- User registration for team members (inherits admin's company)

## Company Isolation Now Enforced

✅ **Users Management:** Admins can only see/manage users from their own company
✅ **Project Visibility:** Users can only see projects from their own company
✅ **Statistics:** User statistics are now company-specific
✅ **Cross-Company Access:** Completely blocked between different companies

## Key Security Principles Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users only see data they need from their company
2. **Data Isolation:** Complete separation between companies
3. **Access Control:** Company-based filtering at the database level
4. **Validation:** Comprehensive testing to ensure fixes work correctly

The application now has proper multi-tenant security with complete company isolation!
